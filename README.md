##About
The Game of Life is a Cellular Automata. This automata consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells. By following simple rules interesting behaviour can emerge.

The default rules are as followed:

Any live (black) cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by needs caused by underpopulation.
Any live (black) cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead (white) cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes an live cell.
This implementation of Conway’s Game of Life allows you to add well known starting conditions which emerge into self-repeating (oscillating), chaotic and/or self-destructive patterns.
You can also toggle the state of any cell by simply clicking it.
